# Modern Data Warehouse OpenHack

## Setting up Permissions 

Before continuing ensure you understand the permissions needed to run the OpenHack on your Azure subscription.

Attendees should have Azure subscription permissions which allow the creation of resources in their resource group. Additionally, attendees should have sufficient subscription permissions to create service principals in Azure AD and to register applications in Azure AD. Typically, all that is required is a user account with `Owner` role on their resource group.

## Common Azure Resources

The following is a list of common Azure resources that are deployed and utilized during the OpenHack. 

Ensure that these services are not blocked by Azure Policy.  As this is an OpenHack, the services that attendees can utilize are not limited to this list so subscriptions with a tightly controlled service catalog may run into issues if the service an attendee wishes to use is disabled via policy.

| Azure resource           | Resource Providers |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Azure Cosmos DB          | Microsoft.DocumentDB 
| Azure Data Factory       | Microsoft.DataFactory                   |
| Azure Databricks         | Microsoft.Databricks                    |
| Azure SQL Database       | Microsoft.SQL                           |
| Azure Storage            | Microsoft.Storage                       |
| Azure Data Lake Store    | Microsoft.DataLakeStore                 |
| Azure Virtual Machines   | Microsoft.Compute                       |

## Attendee Computers

Attendees will be required to install software on the workstations that they are performing the OpenHack on. Ensure they have adequate permissions to perform software installation.

## Deployment Instructions 

1. Open a **PowerShell ISE** window, run the following command, if prompted, click **Yes to All**:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
   ```

2. The latest version of the Azure PowerShell cmdlets do **NOT** work with this script. You will need to use an earlier version (noted below)

    ```PowerShell
    Install-Module -Name Az -RequiredVersion 4.2.0 -Force -AllowClobber -SkipPublisherCheck
    ```

    > Note: If you need to uninstall first: [Uninstall the Azure PowerShell Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/uninstall-az-ps?view=azps-4.6.0)

3. If you installed an update, **close** the PowerShell ISE window, then **re-open** it. This ensures that the latest version of the Az module is used.

4. Execute the following to sign in to the Azure account that has the **Owner** role assignment in your subscription.

    ```PowerShell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

5. If you have more than one subscription, be sure to select the right one before the next step. Use `Get-AzSubscription` to list them and then use the command below to set the subscription you're using:

    ```powershell
    Select-AzSubscription -Subscription <The selected Subscription Id>
    ```

6. Assign the `$sqlpwd` and `$vmpwd` variables in your PowerShell session as **Secure Strings**. Be sure to use a strong password for both. Follow [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/faq#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm) for Virtual Machine password requirements and [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/password-policy?view=sql-server-2017#password-complexity) for SQL Server.

    ```powershell
    $sqlpwd = "ThePasswordYouWantToUseForSQL" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
    $vmpwd = "ThePasswordYouWantToUseForTheVM" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
    ``` 

7. Assign the `$containerSAS` variable in your PowerShell session also as a **Secure String**. This is a rwl SAS scoped to the dbbackups container:

    ```powershell
    $sasToken = "[replace with SAS token receieved from the Opsgility team]"
    $containerSAS = $sasToken | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
    ```

8. Execute the following to deploy the environment (this process may take 10-15 minutes):

    ```powershell
     .\BYOS-deployAll.ps1 -SqlAdminLoginPassword $sqlpwd -VMAdminPassword $vmpwd -BackupStorageContainerSAS $containerSAS
    ```

### Manual step - Assigning Users to Each Resource Group 

After deployment, manually add the appropriate users with owner access on the appropriate resource group for their team. 

See the following for detailed instructions for assigning users to roles.

[Add or remove Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal)

## Validate 
Resource Groups exist for each of the teams, members are in each team appropriately with owner permission on the resource group.

Prerequisites/other things to check for each team:

The deployment of the Modern Data Warehousing OpenHack Lab environment includes the following for each team.

##### Southridge Video Resources

- Two Azure SQL DBs in a single logical server
- A Cosmos DB account with a single collection for the movie catalog

##### Fourth Coffee Resources

- A VM with a directory of CSV data

##### VanArsdel, Ltd. Resources
